      <div class="col-right">
        <p>Moving into a new apartment is a hassle, and an involved process. On the day a renter gets their keys, they do an initial walk through with their landlord to document flaws that they don’t want to be held responsible for. This process is manual and a “black box”. There’s no guarantee of a landlord keeping a record of that, which often results in them charging renters upon moving out for damage they didn’t create. So we create a convenient experience for documenting status of items in the room to make sure the landlord and the renter are on the same page on condition of all items in the room when renters move in, and then use the same tool for move-out walkthrough to document any damaged items, send to the landlord for review, and confirm security deposit return.</p>

        <p>1. Have landlords/property managers suggested renters to check the condition of the place they are going to rent?

             3. When renters move out of the place with damages, how does the communication work between the landlord and the tenant to get issues/disputes resolved?</p></p>

          <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>1. Lack of communication about inventory check during move in time could cause disputed charges during move out between the landlord and the tenant.
        <br>  2. Renters are unaware of making inventory when they move in.</p>

          <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>1. Help bridge the gap of inventory communication by guiding renters to log items upon move in and report to landlord in a timely manner.
       <br>   2. Facilitate smooth move out experience between the landlord and the tenant by revisiting inventory, payments, addressing damanges (if any), and confirming security deposit return.

  Kattie is a 22 years old student graduate school student who just moved from Pittsburgh to NYC.

Document every item in the room to avoid future conflicts with landlords. <br>

  2. Keep good communication with the landlord. <br>
  
  3. Make the room as tidy as possible when she move-out to get her security deposit back.

        <p>In reference of my user interviews and personas, I began to map out the key stages.

The workflow suppose to improve: <br> 1. Onboarding experience to raise awareness of inventory check upon move in.
      <br>    2. Highlight items for renters to look out for (easy-to-damage area that may cause dispute upon move out) to prevent unnecessary charges upon move out.
      <br> 3. Facilitate communication between the landlord and the tenant. </p>
